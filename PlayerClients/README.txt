How to use this folder:

In eclipse: 
	- Right click 
	- Properties > "Java Buld Path" > Add class folder
	- select this folder
	- Player created .class files should now be accessible in the project, and can be checked in via github.
	
You can add your .JAVA file to .gitignore so that you can keep it in your src directory without checking it in.


Via command line its probably easier to just move everything to one folder.
